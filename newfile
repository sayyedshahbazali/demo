This works fine in the existing setup, but on the new box it returns a
"File Not Found" error at this line. If I hard code a path in there
(i.e. "C:\temp\Upload.ini") it will work, but I don't want to do that.
So my question is, why isn't this working? It should be trying to read
UpLoad.ini from the same directory that the .dll file is registered in,
right? (in this case, C:\WINDOWS\System32) Is it a permissions issue?
I've tried giving IUSR_* and SYSTEM accounts read/write access to that
folder (against my better judgement) as well as to the folder the code
is ultimately going to write to (that's a whole other, but perhaps
similar, ball of wax).
